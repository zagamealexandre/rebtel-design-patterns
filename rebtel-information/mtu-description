# MTU — Mobile Top-Up at Rebtel

This document gives a consolidated overview of **MTU (Mobile Top-Up)** at Rebtel, combining information from MTU, MTU Revamping, 2.5 Mexico MTU, and Marketplace/Hydra documentation into a single reference for Product, Commercial, and Engineering teams.

# 1. MTU Domain — What It Is and Why It Matters

Mobile Top-Up (MTU) is the part of Rebtel where customers:

- Select a **country + operator + product** (credit or bundles).
- Pay with one of our **payment methods**.
- Trigger a **recharge** to a recipient’s number through an external **supplier / aggregator**.

MTU is tightly connected to:

- **Marketplace / Hydra** → product configuration, routing, pricing, promotions, limits.
- **Payments** → authorization, settlement, refunds.
- **Subscriptions** → recurring MTU where enabled.
- **CRM & Growth** → campaigns, welcome offers, reactivation flows.

At a high level, the MTU domain covers:

- Product catalog (what can be bought, in which corridor).
- UX flows (Web, iOS, Android).
- Routing and provider integrations.
- Commercial levers (price lists, campaigns, fees, limits).
- Monitoring and operational tooling.

# 2. MTU Products and Catalog

## 2.1 Product Definition

Each MTU product typically includes:

- **id** → internal product ID (Hydra/Marketplace)
- **CountryId** → destination country code (e.g., `MX`, `HT`)
- **Operator / Provider** → telco brand and/or aggregator
- **Title** → customer-facing name
- **Description** → bundle or product explanation
- **Denominations** → fixed amounts or ranges
- **Type**
  - Standard credit (e.g., "$10 Airtime")
  - Bundles (data, voice, SMS, combos)
  - Promotions (bonus credit, double top-up, extra data)

Product data originates from external **suppliers**, then is transformed and configured in **Hydra / Marketplace** before being exposed in customer-facing flows.

## 2.2 Supplier Dynamics

Suppliers update their product catalogs frequently:

- New products may be added.
- Existing products may be:
  - Removed or deactivated.
  - Renamed or re-described.
  - Re-priced.
  - Re-categorized.
- Technical flags (routable, subscription availability, promotions) may change.

Because of this, the MTU catalog is **dynamic** and requires:

- Automated synchronization.
- Monitoring and validation.
- Periodic manual review for high-impact markets.

---

# 3. Subscriptions vs One-Off Products

MTU products can be:

- **One-off top-ups** → single recharge purchases.
- **Subscription-enabled products** → recurring scheduled top-ups.

Not all products support subscriptions. Subscription availability depends on:

- Supplier technical capabilities.
- Commercial viability.
- Routing configuration.
- Market strategy.

Clear separation between subscription and one-off flows is a key UX and commercial principle.

# 4. MTU Revamping — Direction & Principles

MTU Revamping (MTU 3.0 efforts) aims to:

- Simplify the buy flow.
- Reduce friction.
- Improve conversion.
- Align cross-platform behavior.
- Increase operational clarity.

## Core Principles

- **Drastic simplification** → Reduce overlapping bundles and confusing variants.
- **Behavior-based ordering** → Sort products by popularity, recency, and business rules.
- **Cross-platform consistency** → Same corridor/product behavior across Web, iOS, and Android.
- **Clear mapping** → Supplier product → Internal product → Frontend variant.

## Focus Areas

- Product list UX (sorting, highlighting popular options).
- Clear subscription vs one-off separation.
- Better collaboration between Commercial and Engineering.
- Improved observability and traceability across systems.

# 5. 2.5 Mexico MTU — Market-Specific Initiative

Mexico is a priority MTU market with focused optimization work.

Key areas:

- Product assortment optimization.
- Pricing and margin balancing.
- Campaign design (welcome offers, reactivation bonuses).
- Operator prioritization.
- Mexico-specific UX considerations (currency, language, value perception).

## Typical Goals

- Improve product selection → successful recharge conversion.
- Increase repeat rate and LTV.
- Reduce support tickets and complaints.
- Validate revamp patterns before scaling to other markets.

---

# 6. Marketplace & Hydra — Configuration Backbone

MTU products rely heavily on Marketplace and Hydra configuration.

These systems define:

- Which products are visible.
- Retail pricing and service fees.
- Supplier routing logic.
- Subscription eligibility.
- Limits (per-user and per-product).
- Campaign eligibility.
- Special routing behaviors (e.g., Cuba alternative flows).

Together, these systems determine how MTU behaves commercially and technically.

# 7. MTU KPIs & Monitoring

## Core Funnel

- Sessions
- Product selection
- Payment initiated
- Successful recharge

## Key Metrics

- Success rate by corridor, operator, supplier.
- Average Order Value (AOV).
- Margin per corridor.
- Subscription attach rate.
- Refund and dispute rates.
- Supplier callback reliability.

Monitoring relies on:

- Application logs.
- Supplier callback tracking.
- BI dashboards (e.g., Snowflake or equivalent analytics tools).
- Operational alerting systems.

---

# 8. Operational Playbook (High-Level)

For day-to-day MTU operations:

- Monitor newly introduced or changed products from suppliers.
- Review high-impact markets regularly.
- Ensure pricing, routing, and limits align with strategy.
- Follow MTU Revamping principles when:
  - Introducing new product variants.
  - Adjusting product ordering.
  - Launching campaigns.
  - Designing new flows.

Before modifying key corridors:

- Review market-specific documentation (e.g., Mexico MTU).
- Validate commercial and technical implications.
- Ensure consistency across platforms.

# Summary

MTU is a cross-functional domain combining:

- Supplier integrations.
- Marketplace configuration.
- Payments infrastructure.
- Subscriptions.
- Commercial strategy.
- UX optimization.

It is dynamic, commercially sensitive, and operationally complex — requiring strong coordination between Product, Engineering, Commercial, Growth, and Operations.
